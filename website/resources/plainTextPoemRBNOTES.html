<h1> Poem About Me And All My Thoughts and Feelings And How Everything Is Connected.</h1>
<h2>Words BIRTH Worlds</h2>


<div class = "thematic"> who am i</div>
<!-- <h3>I am</h3> -->
<div class = "stanza">
I am always talking
often
out loud
sometimes 
to other people
more often with myself

I have always had more to say then people had 
time to listen
So I started writing it down
to save for later
when people had more time
or I had figured out how to say everything I had to say
in shorter amounts of
time
I have set out to
Organize it and make it beautiful
So people will take the time to listen
And so my obsession with language
<p
Became a poem

<h1>_Words Birth Worlds_</h1>


<h2>I feel like I think in parallel instead of in sequence </h2>

<div class = "stanza">
I understand things all at once or kind of not at all
It’s hard for me to focus on one thing  <!-- {{thing animates into different ‘things} -->
Because I don’t understand any one thing
Without its everything else
</div>



<div class = "thematic"> prisons and free: the windup</div>

<h2>Everything is so obviously connected</h2>


If I could just wrap my mind and mouth around it all
I could explain to this judge why my
{{best friend/brother/anyone }}
shouldn’t be sent to prison
Melea being dead is enough
Everytime a person kills another person two communities suffer the trauma
and sometimes
like this
// <time datetime="2011-01-12">January 12th, 2011</time>
time
for many people those communities are the same
double trauma
at intersectional rates (of velocity? what is the measurement of intersectional effect?)
of
Weight for all of us for the rest of our lives
(which is to say I'm in grad school Melea's dead and Hollis is in Prison and Chris is and Greg and Eda are and Ainye and Terry are....
so effected.
each person
at each end of
every gun
when a human shoots another human
are from people
who love people
who will never be the same
and )
Please don’t hurt anyone else
here in this court room
The hurricane needn’t take with it the thunder

---POEM 2 (which is one of the good ones--)
++use origami I think here++
Sending people to prison
Is not what it seems
Humans don’t belong in cages
That is a truth
More powerful then law
or reality
Look inside yourself
You’ll see
(We?)


I have never felt more powerless
then when there was nothing I could say
to stop my friend from having shot the women he called sister
and all that has happened after that
Trauma and imagination can make
for fertile ground
I began to imagine there was (is)
a sacred math of the universe
which seemed always just out of reach
Right when you need it most
Like while I’m watching my best friend/brother be sentenced for murder
If I could just find the right words to explain it all to everyone
I could-

// animate or rotate or show the part of the same group somehow
[
"Get my friend/brother out of prison ",
"Speak to all the people in my life who have died too soon",
"And right on time",
"And to",
"Protect … the people I love, everyone, all the humans at least",
"There is plenty of room on this Arc ",
"I promise ",
"Say I’m sorry",
"Speak to my family more",
"Not feel so weird and unable to express myself so often when it feels like I have something so important to say",
]

I have notebooks filled with poems
not good enough for a judge to let
my friends
out of
the cages they are in

I want so badly for them to be known
I, also just want to be known
Don’t you
Can ‘we’ call it a ‘we?’
we want to be known
us humans
have stories
and families
and
I’ve always wanted to be known more then anything
And language for me has become a medium for me to have agency in being known
To you
And we
And other such silly people for whom living is living
And free is free
Imagine a language
in which you felt known
Language for me is a method
to let other people they are seen
// or || know I see them.
// And feel seen myself

I see you
You exist
And you are so fucking special
Seriously,
{{running list of people's names (with notes?) start with Aaron Montoya and demo and get help doing it. }}
{{"add your name to the list?"}}

We are such amazing beings
Us humans—
And you {{x}}, you{{x}} are loved
And you are forgiven

<div class = "thematic" >{THE SWITCH AND WHITE SUPREMECY}</div>


<h1>And we need to check ourselves more
Especially us white men</h1>
<!-- ++use origami or flip to challenge this word ++ -->
Who can’t seem to stop shooting people
Seriously.
White supremacy is destroying the world.
This is not a drill.
It’s like a mental disease we have that
We won’t admit exists
And we’re taking the planet down with us
If you or someone you know is susceptible to being white, please have them checked for white supremacy.
And if yourself are white,
then please, hear me,
There is a mental disease and it will never feel like you have it and you can't know unless you trust for a second that you might
Otherwise you will support and propegate it
all the while screaming like a lunatic
that you're not a racist
you have undiagnosed
white-supremecy
It will just feel like your mind
And it will eat at you
Until you are
A cavern inside
And have burned everything you love.
</div>

<!-- <h1>Hope and Healing</h1> -->
There is relief
Imagine a language of hope and healing

<div class = "thematic">Language and Reality </div>


<div class = "stanza">
I need a language to convince people of the other worlds and ways of being I s(P)e(A)e(K)
Because reality has this way of appearing
to be all there is

Like when something is moving so fast it seems to be still

we have been mislead to mistake
ourselves for a still framed portrait of the past
We’ve been made to make believe
That reality is an untouchable museum
And history a completed painting hanging in its halls

We are taught learning is being given a tour of the museum
And being alive
is shopping for the newest trends in the real life-giftshop of the museum of reality

we are not just consumers and curators of reality
we are creators of the highest magnitude
It is us who behead the sun
to draw a new horizon across earth’s
latitude
Our arms are easels
To hold each others artwork
from our imagined worlds
Our mouths-Portals to everyone we’ve ever talked to
The rest of the ways we speak
and let ourselves be known
with our entire bodies
all art
is a dance

Reality is a contested territory in disguise
The Way Things Are
is a Holographic Misinterpretation of the sacred signs

we have been made to mistake
our weapons and masks for
our mouths and lungs
Confused What’s happened to us
For what we’ve become

<!-- the banks of our memories are sites of struggle
our minds are weapons
and they are also battlefields
that’s why our eyes stay blood shot -->

</div>
<div class = "thematic">

{{its all so tiring to us humans}
</div>

<div class = "stanza">

Its tiring all this living
That keeps happening
Even though they tell you you're in a picture
It hurts so often
||It's easy to imagine yourself in a painting||
||when real life hurts like it does||

The many messages mix a toxic concoction
convincing us we can't matter
amidst how insecure and broken hearted
we always seem to feel
not ever enough
no matter how many images are reproduced of us
it can almost feel like we don't exist
amongst all these images of
not who we are

</div>
</div>
<div class = "thematic">

{BACK TO ME AND BEING ALL SENSITIVE AND STUFF}
</div>
<div class = "stanza">

I feel a lot and deeply
All the time
And with all the thinking and feeling
It’s hard

The wind
Can hurt
When you’re walking around
All open and raw
Becoming yourself
On the streets
Are filled with selves
And wind
And hurt
A cacophony of pain whistling
Through the city

Our bones carry the painful memories
That are to shy to scar

Me and the wind go way back
I’ve carved tiny holes through my body
So the wind can
Play the flute through me
I would rather be a wind instrument
Then be a another drum of sorrow
Beaten
Into the rhythm of a city

I need to feel connected and human
And I need a world without injustice and oppression
Because I can’t stop thinking or feeling
And I can’t stop loving people
more then anything
And so I need a better world
So I can be better
</div>
</div>
<!-- /* The Long End */ -->
<div class = "thematic">
</div>
<div class = "stanza">

And I need a language that allows me to talk with people
about how we can heal this world
And reveal the ones who loiter just where the horizon meets the sun
They play make believe
amongst themselves
these wor(l)ds
until they are called into being
reality
{{by us no matter how terrifying *ALorde + Greatest Fear}}

we need
A language for unlearning reality
fot {{unflattening}} (reference to book)
The embedded boundaries and
Sharp edges
Of our colonial language

For us to
["undo"
"open",
"disconnect",
"remove",
"untie",
"unbutton",
"unzip",
"unlash",
"loose",
"loosen",
"free",
"unlock",
"unbolt",
]

Our words from the
Reality they were meant to impose
from the occupation they imply
// its the hidden way the pretend to have no history

The horrific decay filled fantasies of white men
From long before us
Rot in the back of our minds
And convince us
It’s part of who we are

We must rid ourselves
Of what imaginations
White men produced
And then enacted upon the world

// poem from ruta's does this belong?
Unlearning often begins with a question

Individually unwrapping/unraveling
What we believe to be
True about the world
Often on butcher paper
Sometimes in the sky
And we build new collective
Mental models
Constellations are the only shape complex and beautiful enough
For the truth
To take it as its skin

//end ruta poem

It is our job to prepare passages
for the truth to come through
we are weavers of reality
admiring the
emerging pattern we make
forms of language
Which the truth may take on
leaving space in our weavings
That the truth can spread through
like water- {{bruce lee video here- how? figure our remove-figure out}}

And our words (our way with langauge we crash)
Crash like
We will tear down all the walls
Every. Single. One.
That holds humans inside
Or out
Will fall
And until then our words

Will hold place
As a reminder of what future we intend to inhabit
Until only our words
And the ancestors
(Exist)
And these new worlds
Are left

// Our reality is constructed from the imaginations of
// We will be
// And imagine into existence the better worlds that
// Are waiting to be born (brought into being).

So We need a new language (in the programming lanuage sense-how do I bring that out?-what is a programming langauge and what do i mean?)
forged from the possibilities
Of the worlds we will one day inhabit
And for now imagine into being with our words
