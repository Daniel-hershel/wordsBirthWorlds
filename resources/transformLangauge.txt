How Do Our Words Change The World
We Need A Transformative Language
A Language that reveals and recognizes its history
A Language that is interactive
A Language that questions itself
A Language that is like Bruce Lee's Cup Of Water*-that fills and expands to fit the meaning
A forgiving language ||
both in its ability to express and receive forgiveness
and one that allows for 'errors' and new speakers and changes-
forgiving in the way water can be, taking shape to contain and be contained||
A dynamic and improvisational language
A Language of multiple timelines that recognizes theres always a slightly better, more just and wonderful world, waiting to be spoken-drawn into existence
A Language that reminds us they are our better worlds to draw from the aethers
A Language That Imagines New Worlds While Existing Inside The Contradictions Of This One
A Language that implies the truth of the ways we are all connected
A Language where "everything you touch you change and everything you change changes you"
A Language that sequences and phazes
A Language that can say many things at once (and two things at the same time)
A Language that can speak in many voices at once
A Language that can say the same thing as letters, or music, (what else? )
A Language that can facilitate a discussion on reality between time traveling magician cartographers
A Language that can say I love you to someone in prison, to someone who died, to someone you're angry at, to yourself, to who you used to be
