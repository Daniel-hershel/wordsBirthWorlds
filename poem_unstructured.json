"…watching my best friend/brother be sentenced for murder
Trying to say I love you
Loudly and clearly enough
That he won’t spend the rest of his life in a cage
There are no words I can say to stop this from happening
Helpless
If I could just find the right words to explain it all to everyone
I could-",


// [
// "Get my friend/brother out of prison ",
// "Speak to all the people in my life who have died too soon",
// "And right on time",
// "Protect … the people I love, everyone, all the humans at least",
// "There is plenty of room on this Arc ",
// "I promise ",
// "Say I’m sorry",
// “That’s how love and being human works, it’s difficult I know”,
// “And scary”
// “Explain how even a person who has killed someone, has people who love them too…and how that doesn’t mean that it was ok, but it does mean they shouldn’t be in a cage”

"I have notebooks filled with poems
not good enough for a judge to let
my friends
out of
the cages they are in",

"And I have one friend/brother
Who was charged with murder
And it took my white family
Telling police, and lawyers, and anyone who would (or wouldn’t) listen
That this Black man’s Life Mattered
For him to be released
It’s a sickness
A society in decay
That takes a white voice to verify
The worth of a Black life",
 
"I want so badly for the people I love 
to be known
I want so badly 
to be known",

"Don’t you
Can ‘we’ call it a ‘we?’
We? want to be known
us humans
have stories
and families
And
Sending people to prison
Is not what it seems
Humans don’t belong in cages
That is a truth
More powerful then law
or reality",

"We all want to be known
Known in a way that nobody
Would let us be kept in a cage".

"Language for me is a method
to let other people know they are seen
A medium 
for me to have agency in being known
In telling the story of who I am
And how I love
To you
And we
Imagine a language
in which you felt known
Imagine a language of hope and healing",


"I need digital text that can carry the urgency 
I mean with my words
I need a language that allows me to talk with people
about how we can heal this world
And reveal the ones who loiter 
just where the horizon meets the sun
They play make believe
amongst themselves
these wor(l)ds
until they are called into being
By us 
Until they are called reality",

"We need
A language for unlearning reality
fo unflattening
The embedded boundaries and
Sharp edges
Of our colonial language"

// For us to
// ["undo"
// "open",
// "disconnect",
// "remove",
// "untie",
// "unbutton",
// "unzip",
// "unlash",
// "loose",
// "loosen",
// "free",
// "unlock",
// "unbolt",
// ]

"Our words from the
Reality they were meant to impose
from the occupation they imply
The horrific decay filled fantasies of white men
From long before us
Rot in the back of our mouths",

"We must clear the chrysalis
From our mouths
In order to let the butterfly out",

"It is our job to prepare passages
for the truth to come through
We can bring new worlds into existence
By speaking them into being",

"We speak of walls as what separate humans from their being
Until there are no walls between us
Each wall 
we will
tear down
Until there is no language left to demand a wall be built",

"We need more ways to say I forgive you
And less ways to say punish
(I need more ways to say I forgive you, I love you, You hurt me, I’m Sorry).",

"A Language to imagine a world without prisons
A language where putting someone in prison is unimaginable
The language from a future world
where our words are freed 
from the chains that hold the humans
that hold the language back from being free",

"We need a new language
forged from the possibilities
Of the worlds we will one day inhabit
And for now imagine into being with our words"
